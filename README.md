Website Blocker 
Python code for blocking websites.
Writes host file and blocks website 

Gui is used for taking input website names 

During Covid, it was difficult to concentrate on work with youtube and social media one tab away. So I built a desktop application that would take in the websites to be blocked for a specific time and deny access to the user for those websites for a specific time period. I asked my friends and family to use it. I also ran Facebook ads to get user traction. Was able to acquire more than 500 users in a span of 6 months.


Tools used: Tkinter for GUI, Python, OS file operations
